# atm-improvements

This is an exercise from the MIT xPRO full stack development course. It simulates an ATM offering deposits an withdrawals from a virtual bank account. Withdrawals are limited to the amount available. For an improved user experience styling was added and the user has to make a choice whether they want to deposit or withdraw money before the type in the amount in order to avoid confusion. The account balance is diplayed in local format (US) using commas and dots.
